<p>Dr. Bo (Yu-Chien) Ning is a Research Fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K0JR5-kAAAAJ&hl=en"> Molin Wang</a>. 
Before Harvard, he worked at the LPSM at Sorbonne Universit√© in Paris, and at the Department of Statistics at the University of California Davis and Yale University. 
He received his Ph.D. in Statistics from North Carolina State University in 2018.</p>

<p>Dr. Ning holds a broad interest in statistics and data science. 
  He has spent years investigating frequentist properties of Bayesian machine learning methods for complex data, 
  including minimax estimation and uncertainty quantification of various nonparametric and high-dimensional Bayesian models as well as large-scale multiple testing problems. 
  His research style is highly influenced by two amazing researchers and advisors in Bayesian statistical theory, 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u2tifuYAAAAJ&hl=en">Subhashis Ghoshal</a> 
  and <a href="https://perso.lpsm.paris/~castillo/">Ismael Castillo</a>. 
  He is also highly motivated to work with applied scientists in addressing challenging problems in data science, including astronomy, economics, sociology, and public health.
